<h1 class="head flex justify-between mb-4 items-baseline">3D Printing a Transparent PLA Light Diffuser</h1>

<p><img src="https://www.additive-x.com/shop/pub/media/catalog/product/cache/69c0836d7a09588992d42550a1461e94/b/a/bambu_lab_p1s.png" alt="Bambu Lab P1S - without the optional AMS" />
<small class="mt-0 pt-0 italic">I’m working with a Bambu Lab P1S. I love it. As most of my prints are functional rather than decorative, I opted against buying the AMS.<small></small></small></p>

<h2 id="light-diffusion-in-non-oled-displays">Light diffusion in non-OLED displays</h2>

<p>The concept behind edge-lit diffuser panels is fairly straightforward. A light source illuminates the edge of flat piece of transparent material that has been made partially opaque through the inclusion of additives, laser engraving or chemical etching, gently diffusing the light.</p>

<p>The opacity of the material is low enough that 90% of visible light will pass between the panel’s faces unimpeded, but is great enough that the majority of light passing perpendicularly - traversing the material from edge to edge - will not. This light is instead absorbed and scattered by the material’s inclusions, creating a diffuse glow from each face that serves as an excellent source of uniform illumination.</p>

<p>This technique is found ubiquitously in displays, as well as everything from billboards and photography studios to interior design schemes and hospital wards. It’s even been used to create rudimentary touch interfaces by replacing light in the visible spectrum with a source of infrared and <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Low-Cost-Multi-touch-Whiteboard-using-the-Wii-Remo/" target="_blank">employing the tactical use of a Wiimote</a>.</p>

<h2 id="3d-printing-fdm-a-suitable-prototype-panel">3D printing (FDM) a suitable prototype panel</h2>

<p>My current project involves front lighting an e-paper display. After much research into glass etching techniques and wholesale shipping costs of industrial acrylic, I realised one of the core challenges 3D printing enthusiasts face using transparent FDM filaments - that the end result is typically cloudy - was the answer all along.</p>

<p>My goal is to explore whether or not transparent PLA could be the missing option for those looking for an accessible way of producing evenly diffused lighting for their projects without the need for strong acids, meticulous sanding or shipping metre-long panels of plastic thousands of miles.</p>

<p>Other filaments - particularly PETG and ABS - would ostensibly be better suited to this purpose based on their ability to provide a more transparent end result. The barriers I see with these materials over PLA are the need for a heated enclosure and the amount of VOCs released. While my home setup can overcome the former, the latter is still a primary concern; PLA may not be the perfect material for the job, but it’s certainly safer to print in a small apartment than engineering-grade plastics.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, resin printing would also likely make a good candidate for this, too, but I don’t have access to a resin printer, my partner would likely pack their bags if I bought home any more toys, and I’d rather avoid the use of those chemicals in my home.</p>

<h2 id="selecting-a-filament">Selecting a Filament</h2>

<p>There is an abundance of PLA options on the market with various additives, resultant characteristics, and price points. As the core requirement of this project was accessibility to the greatest number of home enthusiasts, I opted against using a premium option. PLA for the most part - additives or not - is PLA. I simply selected the cheapest transparent option available with next-day shipping from Amazon, which at the time of writing was Elegoo’s Transparent PLA+. I believe this cost £12 (~$15).</p>

<h2 id="dialling-in-print-settings">Dialling in Print Settings</h2>

<p>A material’s transparency and optical characteristics are heavily impacted by its uniformity, which makes achieving an acceptable end result using FDM printing a challenge. Layer lines are part of the issue, but equally, layer adhesion and differences in cooling speed also play a role in the product’s finish. In broad terms, best results are achieved by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using a heated bed and untextured build plate.</li>
  <li>Disabling part cooling to slow solidification of the filament.</li>
  <li>Increasing the nozzle temperature to the limit of - or even slightly over - spec.</li>
  <li>Increasing the flow rate and layer height.</li>
  <li>Printing as slowly as possible.</li>
  <li>Using a larger nozzle diameter.</li>
</ul>

<p>In simple terms: print hot, print thick, and print slow. All of these settings serve to increase the bond between layers as much as possible. Increasing the flow rate is purported to have a positive impact on the optical characteristics of the end result, but in my own experimentation this had rapidly diminishing returns.</p>

<p>During my experimentation I only changed variables that wouldn’t necessitate the purchase of additional parts. That meant printing on the standard textured build plate and using the stock nozzle with a diameter of 0.4mm.</p>

<p>I experimented with several settings on the P1S with differing results:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Nozzle Temp</th>
      <th>Layers</th>
      <th>Bed</th>
      <th>Fans</th>
      <th>Print Speed</th>
      <th>Ironing</th>
      <th>Flow Rate</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>210</td>
      <td>0.2mm</td>
      <td>50C</td>
      <td>100%</td>
      <td>100%</td>
      <td>OFF</td>
      <td>0.98</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>220</td>
      <td>0.28mm</td>
      <td>50C</td>
      <td>50%</td>
      <td>75%</td>
      <td>ON**</td>
      <td>1.08**</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>230</td>
      <td>0.3 mm</td>
      <td>55C</td>
      <td>0%</td>
      <td>50%</td>
      <td>ON**</td>
      <td>1.08**</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>235*</td>
      <td>0.3 mm</td>
      <td>55C</td>
      <td>0%</td>
      <td>33%</td>
      <td>OFF</td>
      <td>1.1**</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>*this setting is out of spec for either the printer or filament.</p>

<p>**this setting will increase the likelihood of nozzle clogging.</p>

<h2 id="post-processing-to-improve-transparency">Post-processing to Improve Transparency</h2>

<p>Print settings will help get close to the finished result, and this may be appropriate for use as-is in backlight applications, but in order to achieve an acceptable level of transparency to use this panel as a front light, post-processing of the sheet will be required.</p>

<p>Improving the surface finish of PLA at home is generally achieved by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chemical smoothing using Ethyl Acetate.</li>
  <li>Heat treatment using an iron.</li>
  <li>Sanding the surface using fine grit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, I’ve experimented with these options to see which is the most optimal for this application.</p>

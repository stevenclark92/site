Occupying a niche above the Paper White but at a price point that remained within reach of the majority of consumers, the device offered a better display, automatic brightness adjustment and a more refined design that included page turn buttons with haptic feedback (added in response to countless user reviews lambasting the reading experience offered by touch-only models). </p>

<p>Not long after its release - and with only a single generation produced - it was retired from sale and replaced by the Oasis. The Oasis is a lovely device to be sure, but with a significantly larger screen and a vastly inflated price, the mid-tier market was widely expected to transition to the lower-spec models following the voyage’s EOL. This did happen for the most part, but unexpectedly, the lack of a direct successor has also driven significant demand for second-hand Voyages even today in 2024.</p>

<h2 id="unplanned--obsolescence">Unplanned (👀) Obsolescence</h2>

<p>Kindles are extremely simple devices from a hardware perspective, and little has changed regarding their architecture since the launch of the earliest models. Arguably, the only technology category that’s progressed more slowly than the ebook reader is the book itself. But then, nor has the technology doing the reading, so why would either need to improve?</p>

<p>Sure, touch was added a few generations in and the newer models are waterproof, but under the hood they’re still running the same 1 GHz-ish processor with the same half-GB-ish of ram, with a monochrome display, a WiFi chipset, a pitiful amount of onboard storage and a front light.</p>

<p>Unlike the book, however, and as simple as ebook readers are by modern technological standards, they have a few key failure points that render them unusable after a decade or so of service:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lithium Ion batteries have extremely finite lifespans.</li>
  <li>eMMC has a limited number of write cycles.</li>
  <li>USB connectors fail, as do solder joints.</li>
  <li>People like me get a bit brave and “brick” them by deleting or corrupting firmware.</li>
  <li>People unlike me “brick” them in the process of following standard update procedures…</li>
  <li>Software developers tire of porting code to legacy components and sunset perfectly capable devices in favour of supporting the newer, shinier versions.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a crying shame from an environmental standpoint - a Kindle from 2015 has virtual feature parity with one from 2024, but due to these failure points the former can be found in droves on eBay for pennies (and probably in greater numbers still in drawers and landfills) while the latter commands a price that makes little sense given the old rope hidden behind the glossy bezel.</p>

<h2 id="light-diffusion-in-non-oled-displays">Light diffusion in non-OLED displays</h2>

<p>The concept behind edge-lit diffuser panels is fairly straightforward. A light source illuminates the edge of flat piece of transparent material that has been made partially opaque through the inclusion of additives, laser engraving or chemical etching, gently diffusing the light.</p>

<p>The opacity of the material is low enough that 90% of visible light will pass between the panel’s faces unimpeded, but is great enough that the majority of light passing perpendicularly - traversing the material from edge to edge - will not. This light is instead absorbed and scattered by the material’s inclusions, creating a diffuse glow from each face that serves as an excellent source of uniform illumination.</p>

<p>This technique is found ubiquitously in displays, as well as everything from billboards and photography studios to interior design schemes and hospital wards. It’s even been used to create rudimentary touch interfaces by replacing light in the visible spectrum with a source of infrared and <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Low-Cost-Multi-touch-Whiteboard-using-the-Wii-Remo/" target="_blank">employing the tactical use of a Wiimote</a>.</p>

<h2 id="3d-printing-fdm-a-suitable-prototype-panel">3D printing (FDM) a suitable prototype panel</h2>

<p>My current project involves front lighting an e-paper display. After much research into glass etching techniques and wholesale shipping costs of industrial acrylic, I realised one of the core challenges 3D printing enthusiasts face using transparent FDM filaments - that the end result is typically cloudy - was the answer all along.</p>

<p>My goal is to explore whether or not transparent PLA could be the missing option for those looking for an accessible way of producing evenly diffused lighting for their projects without the need for strong acids, meticulous sanding or shipping metre-long panels of plastic thousands of miles.</p>

<p>Other filaments - particularly PETG and ABS - would ostensibly be better suited to this purpose based on their ability to provide a more transparent end result. The barriers I see with these materials over PLA are the need for a heated enclosure and the amount of VOCs released. While my home setup can overcome the former, the latter is still a primary concern; PLA may not be the perfect material for the job, but it’s certainly safer to print in a small apartment than engineering-grade plastics.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, resin printing would also likely make a good candidate for this, too, but I don’t have access to a resin printer, my partner would likely pack their bags if I bought home any more toys, and I’d rather avoid the use of those chemicals in my home.</p>

<h2 id="selecting-a-filament">Selecting a Filament</h2>

<p>There are an abundance of PLA options on the market with various additives, resultant characteristics, and price points. As the core requirement of this project was accessibility to the greatest number of home enthusiasts, I opted against using a premium option. PLA for the most part - additives or not - is PLA. I simply selected the cheapest transparent option available with next-day shipping from Amazon, which at the time of writing was Elegoo’s Transparent PLA+. I believe this cost £12 (~$15).</p>

<h2 id="dialling-in-print-settings">Dialling in Print Settings</h2>

<p>A material’s transparency and optical characteristics are heavily impacted by its uniformity, which makes achieving an acceptable end result using FDM printing a challenge. Layer lines are part of the issue, but equally, layer adhesion and differences in cooling speed also play a role in the product’s finish. In broad terms, best results are achieved by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using a heated bed and untextured build plate.</li>
  <li>Disabling part cooling to slow solidification of the filament.</li>
  <li>Increasing the nozzle temperature to the limit of - or even slightly over - spec.</li>
  <li>Increasing the flow rate and layer height.</li>
  <li>Printing as slowly as possible.</li>
  <li>Using a larger nozzle diameter.</li>
</ul>

<p>In simple terms: print hot, print thick, and print slow. All of these settings serve to increase the bond between layers as much as possible. Increasing the flow rate is purported to have a positive impact on the optical characteristics of the end result, but in my own experimentation this had rapidly diminishing returns.</p>

<p>During my experimentation I only changed variables that wouldn’t necessitate the purchase of additional parts. That meant printing on the standard textured build plate and using the stock nozzle with a diameter of 0.4mm.</p>

<p>I experimented with several settings on the P1S with differing results:</p>

<table>

      <th>Nozzle Temp</th>
      <th>Layers</th>
      <th>Bed</th>

<p>*this setting is out of spec for either the printer or filament.</p>

<p>**this setting will increase the likelihood of nozzle clogging.</p>

<h2 id="post-processing-to-improve-transparency">Post-processing to Improve Transparency</h2>

<p>Print settings will help get close to the finished result, and this may be appropriate for use as-is in backlight applications, but in order to achieve an acceptable level of transparency to use this panel as a front light, post-processing of the sheet will be required.</p>

<p>Improving the surface finish of PLA at home is generally achieved by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chemical smoothing using Ethyl Acetate.</li>
  <li>Heat treatment using an iron.</li>
  <li>Sanding the surface using fine grit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, I’ve experimented with these options to see which is the most optimal for this application.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="3D_Printing" /><category term="Stub" /><category term="Notes" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m working with a Bambu Lab P1S.

<p>Monostable 555s - at least in the configurations I’ve tried - will output for as long as the trigger is pulled low, even if the length of the delay based on R1 and C1 is shorter than the trigger duration. In practice, a one-shot timer configured to have a 0.01 millisecond pulse will not provide a 0.01 millisecond high output signal consistently from a button, as any deviation in the duration of the button press (over this time, at least) will be reflected in the output signal.</p>

In order to single cycle these chips, it’s better to pull RDY low. Depending on the specific model the outcome will be different.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For the NMOS 6502, pulling RDY low will hold state on a read operation. Write operations will finish with state only held on the next read.</li>
  <li>For the CMOS 65C02, pulling RDY low will hold the state regardless of the current operation type.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is important as outputs will differ based on the specific processor in use.</p>

<p>Should I wish to try and single-clock the 65C02, the clock must be held <em>high</em> not <em>low</em>. Single stepping involves pulling the signal low for no longer than 5 microseconds. Longer than this and the integrity of data stored in registers cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<p>The NMOS 6502 cannot be held in either state.</p>

<h3 id="interfacing-with-esp32-serial-monitor">Interfacing with ESP32 Serial Monitor</h3>

<p>There are two ways I can see to single step these chips using the ESP32 Serial Monitor tool I wrote; The first of these will only work for the CMOS 65C02:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide the 65C02 with a constant high signal from the ESP32 on the clock in pin.</li>
  <li>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delayMicroseconds(5)</code> in the Arduino IDE to pulse the clock low to cycle the clock.</li>
  <li>Pull the pin high again at the end of this delay.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rough Arduino sketch of this approach can be found <a href="https://github.com/stevenclark92/stESP32/blob/main/stESP32_clockPulse.ino">here</a>. It’s pretty janky but works more or less. Not a practical solution in current form.</p>

<p>I need to explore the accuracy of these delay pulses to ensure the data in registers is still valid. /todo</p>

<p>The second method I can see that would work on both processors is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide a clock signal using a hardware clock. I’ll use 1 MHz for testing.</li>
  <li>Pull RDY (pin 2) low using the ESP32.</li>
  <li>Pulse RDY using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">delayMicroseconds(1)</code> for single steps that match the 1 MHz clock frequency.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will depend on how well the microcontroller is able to accurately pulse for such short periods. Equally, the NMOS chip will continue performing writes until the next read instruction. I need to ensure - if possible - that I am able to read from the bus quickly enough that no steps are missed. It’s very hard to do this via serial at 1 MHz. It might be best to clock the NMOS chip down to its lowest stable configuration - I think it’s 100 KHz. I should be able to do this using Schmitt triggers, provided they provide a clean and stable enough signal.</p>

<p>Onwards and upwards.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Electronics" /><category term="Stub" /><category term="Notes" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rockwell 6502 and 65C02 chips can’t single cycle based on the clock signal the same way as WD processors can.

<h1 class="head flex justify-between mb-4 items-baseline">Intro to Kindleology</h1>

<p>Recently, I purchased my fifth Amazon Kindle in twice as many years. My buying habits are not motivated by a desire to have the latest and greatest at all times - my phones and laptops generally last for many years, and I only upgrade them begrudgingly - instead, the Kindle coincidentally manages to be perfectly designed both for its intended function and to be lost or broken by me.</p>

<p>My issue lies categorically outside the device’s design, and the few Amazon devices I’ve owned that have passed from natural causes have only done so at the end of a long and useful lifespan. It’s a prime example of PICNIC, one I’m compelled to address.</p>

<h3 id="the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-brain-disabled">The perks of being a <del>wallflower</del> brain disabled</h3>

<p>Concurrently, the neurodivergence implicated in the incessant loss of and damage to my possessions has sparked a lifelong and unyielding desire to take absolutely everything apart to see how it works. My first thought from a young age upon seeing a functioning electronic device has always been: <strong>“Absolutely, categorically, and definitively not”.</strong></p>

<p>Starting around age 6, the majority of my belongings have - at one time or another - found themselves strapped to Dr Frankenstein Jr’s table, fixed by the monstrous glare of a half-pint mad scientist gleefully prying component after component free from the shackles of its housing, only to have the boy’s well of motivation run dry approximately two-thirds of the way through putting the screws back in. The Kindles I’ve owned as an adult have fared only slightly better.</p>

<p>In much the same way that a child learns to untie its shoes long before it learns to fasten them alone, from a youth spent torturing electronics came (much, much later) the ability to <em>unbreak</em> them. Today, most of my devices find shelter under the protection spell of ‘having a warranty I don’t want to void’, but broken and old devices remain ripe for experimentation and potential salvation. To date, I’ve found a serviceable bodge for most day-to-day electronics issues short of leaving things on a bus - at least, one that will last until I find time to order a replacement.</p>

<p>This time, however, the goal is not merely to restore stock functionality; I want to surpass it.</p>

<h3 id="dont-try-this-at-home-if-you-dont-know-what-youre-doing">Don’t try this at home if you don’t know what you’re doing.</h3>

<p>This article is part of a planned series where I will explore how to perform a total hardware and software diagnostic and repair of a broken Kindle Voyage, before outlining possible modifications for those with the requisite technical skills. Many of these steps will equally apply to other devices for reasons that will become obvious, but I will disclaim early that <strong>this is not intended to be a guide or to act as instructions</strong>. If you choose to follow in my footsteps, <strong>on your head be any damage to your devices or statutory standing with Amazon</strong>.</p>

<p>I will cite my sources and share the resources I found throughout this process; however, most information has been sourced from the depths of long-dead forum posts and Reddit threads. If I have included a piece of information or a fragment of code that you have created, and I have failed to acknowledge your contribution appropriately, please do reach out so that I can do so.</p>

<p>I must also state that I have no political motivation for this article, nor is it intended to lambast Jeff Bezos or his organization. I believe that I own my devices and have the right to do what I want with them - and that Amazon has the right to keep selling as many new products as they like and withhold support when I inevitably mess something up.</p>

<p>With disclaimers disclaimed and backs covered, let’s get into it.</p>

<h2 id="the-kindle-voyage">The Kindle Voyage</h2>

<p>I started this journey for a specific reason: the Kindle Voyage, released a decade ago this year, was only sold for a limited time, I like it a lot, and you can’t buy it anymore. Occupying a niche above the Paperwhite but at a price point that remained within reach of most consumers, the Voyage offered a better display, automatic brightness adjustment and a more refined design. It had dedicated page turn buttons and haptic feedback, but retained the original form factor and simplicity. It is universally considered one of the best e-book readers ever made, and for me, it occupies the top spot comfortably even now.</p>

<p>[Voyage pic]</p>

<p>Sadly, not long after the only generation of the Kindle Voyage was released, it was retired from sale and replaced by the bigger and more feature-filled Oasis. The Oasis is a lovely device, but with a significantly increased footprint and price, the mid-tier market had to decide between entry-level models or a much higher-end product following the EOL of the Kindle Voyage. The majority bought Paperwhites, but the lack of a direct successor has also driven significant and sustained demand for second-hand Voyages. I find myself in this camp. I <em>could</em> shell out £300 for a Scribe (a brilliant device, itself having replaced the Oasis) or step down to the Paperwhite, but I shall only do so kicking and screaming.</p>

<h3 id="e-book-readers-as-tablet-computers">E-Book Readers as Tablet Computers</h3>

<p>The Kindle Voyage, like all e-book readers, is just a low-end tablet computer. The main (only) distinction between these and other products in their category is the type of screen used. Many other features that set these devices apart from peers in their cohort - such as drastically extended battery life - are secondary benefits that stem from this single architectural decision.</p>

<p><a href="CITE">E-paper displays significantly reduce eye strain compared to other displays</a> but cannot refresh at sub-second intervals due to hardware limitations. There are many articles about this online, so I’ll stop short of a full explanation aside from the most relevant part: Most LCDs used in phones and tablets refresh at 60 Hz or more, but the displays used in e-book readers (partial refresh notwithstanding) generally do so at between 0.25-4 Hz. Higher is possible, but tradeoffs abound beyond this point and I’ve yet to meet anyone who can read four pages per second or more.</p>

<p>Refreshing more slowly requires less power, which means less need for large batteries, leading to smaller, lighter products. LCDs also require current to maintain an image where e-paper displays don’t, but it’s negligible compared to the power required to change state.</p>

<h3 id="slow-and-steady-wins">Slow and Steady Wins</h3>

<p>Rendering greyscale pages very slowly is not particularly intensive from a computational standpoint. As a result, e-book producers rarely tweak more than the herbs and spices; significant hardware revisions are infrequent. Most devices released between 2012 and 2019 are virtually identical behind the bezel, and almost all Kindle variants released in this period used the same processor.  More expensive iterations added touch and light, but the heavy lifting was performed by the same chip, with only minor increases in RAM and eMMC sizes between successive generations.</p>

<p>Arguably, the only technology category that has progressed more slowly than the e-book reader is the book itself. But then, if the fleshy technology doing the reading remains unchanged, why would the silicon that provides the material need to continue to improve once perfected? Using similar hardware under the hood means better ability to support devices long-term, faster iteration of peripheral features, and lower production costs - not to mention the reduced need for environmentally costly factory retooling and the disposal of obsolete components.</p>

<p>The current device line-up as of 2022 represents the first significant hardware revision to Kindles since 2013, and while the processor hails from a new vendor and the RAM has doubled to 1 GB, the primary benefit is 64-bit architecture rather than additional speed. Newer models have an identically clocked processor and perform similarly in benchmarks, so there’s little reason a Kindle from the 2010s couldn’t accomplish the same tasks as one purchased today. Aside from web browsing. And as long as you don’t ask it to play nice with RAM, ROM or files larger than 4 GB. Or look as appealing. Totally the same otherwise.</p>

<h3 id="isnt-that-planned-obsolescence">Isn’t that planned obsolescence?</h3>

<p>No. As simple as e-book readers are by modern technological standards, the regular release cycle of devices is less about cashing in on the desire for novelty and continued forward progression; all electronic devices have a finite lifespan, and a handful of unavoidable failure points render these devices - and most others - unusable after a decade or so of service. The free market guides the rest. </p>

<p>Sure, you could make things easier to repair, but give credit where it’s due - most Kindle devices get at least an 8/10 for repairability from iFixit. Even where the best possible care is always maintained, entropy sees to it that one of the following issues will arise with increasing probability over time in <em>any</em> portable electronic device:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lithium-ion batteries have extremely finite lifespans.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>eMMC has a limited number of write cycles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>USB connectors fail, as do solder joints.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liquid and dust cause corrosion and shorts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People like me get brave and brick them by deleting or corrupting firmware.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People brick them following standard update procedures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Software developers tire of porting code to legacy components and sunset perfectly usable devices in favour of supporting the newer, shinier versions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All these issues are fixable, but diagnostics are costly and time-consuming, and no two devices will have the same repair pathway. Repackaging the same processor and adding a couple of extra features at intervals that roughly align with the expected end-of-life of legacy devices is easy, profitable, and a sensible play from a business standpoint.</p>

<h3 id="so-why-not-just-buy-a-new-one">So why not just buy a new one?</h3>

<p>Even if it’s unavoidable, I still find it a crying shame from an environmental standpoint that an e-book reader from 2014 with virtual feature parity with one from 2021 will be relegated to a drawer, eBay listing or landfill, never again to serve its intended purpose. </p>

<p><em>“I can fix you”, I think to myself as I scroll through the sea of battered devices, “I will fix you”.</em></p>

<p>As a result of slow progress and my clumsiness, more than once, I have paid the same price, years apart, <em>for the same hardware</em>. Obviously, a product has greater value than the sum cost of its components, but I’m not concerned with that for this project. My motivation is simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Because <strong><em>I can.</em></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because <strong><em>it’s fun.</em></strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There’s little more to it than that, and I don’t mean for this post to bring device value into question, nor do I have a strong opinion on that. It’s worth what people are willing to pay. As it turns out, I was willing to pay £20 and three weekends of my life spent descending yet further into madness. Go figure.</p>

<p>The NXP i.MX processors are ARM-based SoCs designed for low-power mobile devices. They’re not the fastest, but they’re full-featured ARM Cortex-based processors well-suited for this application. 512 MB of RAM sounds tiny compared to a modern phone or laptop, but considering the device spends most of its waking time gently cycling through pages of monochrome text, there’s little need for more. Even the limited storage space provides ample capacity for thousands of e-books - even the current flagship model offers only 8 GB of storage and 1 GB of RAM a decade later; plenty for its intended use case.</p>
